# App Description
This app allows students to scan large bodies of text (from a textbook or a website) and performs multiple functions regarding the text. 
The AI will answer to any command entered in the text box at the bottom of the screen. It can answer questions, summarize text, 
emphasize key takeaways, and more. The main distinction between this app and regular AI is that if you click the arrow button on the bottom left corner, 
the AI will ask you questions about the text you inputted. If your answer is wrong, it will clarify the correct answer. 
If you get the answer correct, it will ask a follow up question to further check for comprehension. 

# Inspiration
Nationwide and statewide, there are many students that face difficulty getting access to educational support outside of the classroom. As AI gains increasing popularity 
in our modern society, there are many opportunities to leverage this technology in order to close the learning disparity and provide aspiring students with innovative resources. 
Our app allows students to not only ask questions about the text they are given, but also engage in a two-way dialogue, allowing a much deeper retention of information. 
We wanted to create an app that combines the features of many expensive learning resources in order to create personalized, accessible, and enjoyable learning experiences. 
This will allow for those that can't afford tutors, extra textbooks, or premium softwares to get the education they deserve.

# Possssible Improvements
If we were to create a 2.0 version of the app, we would train the AI with more data, gathered in the initial version, to increase the accuracy of the answers provided 
and the questions generated. Additionally, we could improve the user interface to make it even more lively. This can be done by allowing the user to customize various 
colors and fonts within the app. Lastly, since the software works based on scanned text, we can add validation for blank images. Currently, the app's interface is designed to 
be intuitive and the user can retake pictures as many times as they would like, until the app can get a proper scan for the text. 

Furthermore, since accessibility is the main purpose of this app, we would like to make it compatible with operating systems other than Android, 
including macOS, iOS, Windows, Chrome books, etc.
